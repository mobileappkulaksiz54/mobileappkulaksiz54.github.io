        <h1>"Privacy Policy and Data Management for "Mega Factory Tycoon: Production Grid"</h1>
        <p><strong>Last update:</strong> [17.10.2025]</p>

        <p>This privacy policy explains how the <strong>"[Mega Factory Tycoon: Production Grid]"</strong> mobile application collects, uses and manages user data.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our app only collects the limited data necessary to deliver and enhance the gaming experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Game Data:</strong> All basic game data, such as your game level, virtual money and resource amounts, in-game progress and settings, are stored <strong>only locally on your own device</strong> not on our servers. We do not have remote access to this data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Google Sign-in Data (For Backup Feature):</strong> When you use the feature to back up and restore your game progress to Google Drive, you'll be asked to access basic profile information for your Google account (specifically, your email address) to verify your identity. This information is used only to verify your ownership of the backup and is not processed or stored for any other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Our app may display ads through third-party ad networks, such as Google AdMob. These networks may collect anonymous data, such as your device's advertising ID, to provide ads tailored to your interests. The collection and processing of this data is subject to the respective ad network's own privacy policies.
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>We use the data we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide game functionality and save your game progress.</li>
            <li>To optionally back up and restore your game data to your Google Drive account.</li>
            <li>To support the development and maintenance costs of the app through in-app advertising.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We place great importance on the security of user data. Local data stored on your device is protected by your operating system's standard security measures. Google Drive backup uses Google's own security infrastructure..</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h2>4. Data Deletion Policy and Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Per Google Play policies, we offer all our users the right to delete their data. Because our app doesn't use a server-based account system, "deleting an account" means permanently resetting all local game data and progress on your device.</p>
            <p><strong>To Delete Your Data, Please Follow the Steps Below:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>"[Mega Factory Tycoon: Production Grid]"</strong> open to app.</li>
                <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> (usually represented by a gear icon) from the main menu or the game screen.</li>
                <li>In the Settings menu, look for the option titled <strong>"Reset Game"</strong> or <strong>"Delete All Data"</strong>.</li>
                <li>Once you tap this option, a confirmation window will appear stating that the action is permanent and cannot be undone.</li>
                <li>Once you confirm the action, all your game progress, resources, settings, and other data on your device will be permanently deleted. The app will return to its original state, as if it were installed for the first time.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This action won't automatically delete your backups in Google Drive. If you want to manage your backups separately, you can remove the app's access from your Google Drive settings.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If there are any changes, we will indicate the last updated date at the top of this page. You are encouraged to review the policy regularly.</p>
